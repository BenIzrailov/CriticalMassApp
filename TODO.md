# TODO 

# 1 Create hover aspect for menu items
One feature I would like to include would be the ability to show a picture and description of the menu item when the cursor hovers over the particular dish. This way the customer would be able to make more informed decisions on what to order.

# 2 Fix checkbox to render elements on click
Currently the checkbox function only works when the property of the checkbox is changed manually through the html. This is due to the map elements not being re filtered on the click of the checkbox. Given more time I would fix this functionality. 

# 3  Add media queries
Adding media queries for different monitors, screen sizes, and smoother interface when resizing the windows to provide a seamless experience. 

# 4 Add spice
A meter which allows the user to click and add pepper icons to the dish increasing the spice level of their order

# 5 Ability to order and pay right through the menu
Allow the customer to make their selections and order/pay right from the menu

# 6 Improve overall CSS
Make text and icons clearer as well as improve design and layout.
